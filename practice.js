// Bianry serch Tree 

// You are given a list of numbers stored in a list, A. Your challenge is to build a [Binary Search Tree] (Binary search tree - Wikipedia 959) to store these numbers. You will need to:

// 1 Represent each node of the tree (including its data, left child and right child).
// 2 Print the tree out in an understandable form.
// 3 Make a function to insert a list of numbers (A) into the tree.
// 4 Check if you can insert all the numbers in A into your tree, and that it prints out as expected.

// Reverse Words 
// Write a function that will take a given string 181 and reverse the order of the words. “Hello world” becomes “world Hello” and “May the Fourth be with you” becomes “you with be Fourth the May”

















// Write a function, fibonacciFinder50, that will find the 50th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

// Function Name: fibonacciFinder50
// Input: There are no parameters to this function
// Output: an integer, the 50th number in the Fibonacci Sequence
// Example: fibonacciFinder50() => 7778742049
// In the Fibonacci Sequence 101, the first two numbers are 0 and 1 and every number thereafter is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence
// For this challenge, consider 0 to be the 1st Fibonacci Number, not the 0th (i.e. do not zero-index)
















// Write a function, primeNumberDetector, that tests if a number, n is a prime number.

// Function Name: primeNumberDetector
// Input: integer n
// Output: boolean: true if n is a prime number else false.
// Example: primeNumberDetector(13) => True
